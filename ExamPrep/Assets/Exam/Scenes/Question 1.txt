A 3D tower defence game made in Unity has the following rules: 

 

There is a crosshair in the centre of the screen that the player uses to select a location on the map in order to place a tower. 

Towers become active when a creep comes in range. 

When a tower becomes active it will turn to face the creep and continue targeting the creep so long as it stays in range. 

Towers can fire 5 bullets per second.  

Bullets disappear after 5 seconds if they donâ€™t hit anything 

There are three possible types of creeps and each has an equal probability of being spawned. 

Creeps follow a path to get to the players base. 

When a creep is hit with a bullet, it explodes and after a few seconds, sinks into the ground and gets removed from the scene. 

 

Taking each of the rules above, how you would program them in Unity?
